* Lab 01

** Do not edit these files:
- .travis.yml
- Makefile

** Instructions
Follow the instructions from the 135 lab page:
https://maryash.github.io/135/labs/lab_01.html. For each task (A
through D) write a program named and as specified in the lab. Add each
cpp file to GitHub and make sure to commit and push before the end of
the lab. *Do not* add other files to the repo.

For full credit, write each part so that there is, in addition to the
~main~ function, a single function that performs the actual task. The
function should take parameters as needed. For example ~smaller~
should accept two integers and return an integer: ~int smaller(int a,
int b)~ etc.




Please add the header block as specified in the lab so we can test
Gradescope.
