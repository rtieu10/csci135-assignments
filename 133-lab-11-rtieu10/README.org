* Lab 11

* File structure:
- README.org - this file. fill out the top and use it for notes
- Makefile
- main.cpp - main driver
- funcs.h / funcs.cpp -- add your functions here.
- test.cpp - add your tests
- doctest.h - testing library

The full text of the 136 version of the lab can be found here:
https://maryash.github.io/135/labs/lab_11.html


* Overall notes:
- Write your functions in funcs.cpp
- Write your tests in test.cpp
- I will test your program by running ~make test~ then ~./test~
- Don't add .o, executable or any extraneous files to the repo
- You should commit and push your work frequently
- make sure to add sufficient tests to show that everything works
 
* Specifc changes to the lab
** Task A

Write your Profile class in a files named Profile.h and Profile.cpp.

Make sure Profile.h uses *#pragma once* and it is included in both
Profile.cpp and other files that use the class (main.cpp, test.cpp).

Remember to modify the Makefile as appropriate.

You do not have to test the Profile class as specified in the main
lab, rather write appropriate doctest tests in test.h


** Task B and C

Create the Network class in Network.cpp and Network.h and modify the
other files as needed.

The doctest tests should show the final funcitonality.

** Task D
If you do task D, add the struct definition to Network.h and tests as
appropriate.
