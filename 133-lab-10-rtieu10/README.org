* Overall notes:
- Write your functions in funcs.cpp
- Write your tests in test.cpp
- I will test your program by running ~make test~ then ~./test~
- Don't add .o, executable or any extraneous files to the repo
- You should commit and push your work frequently
- make sure to add sufficient tests to show that everything works
 
* Specifc changes to the lab
** Adding the class
- add the class ~time~ to a file ~time.cpp~ and make the appropriate
  changes to the other files in the repo using the previous lab and
  what you did with the ~Coord3D~ class in ~Coord3D.h~ as a guide.
** Testing
Use doctests to show that each task is completed. As usual running the
tests should not require any user input.
