* File structure:
- README.org - this file. fill out the top and use it for notes
- Makefile
- main.cpp - main driver
- funcs.h / funcs.cpp -- add your functions here.
- test.cpp - add your tests
- doctest.h - testing library
- Data files (tsv as specified in the lab and csv if it's more convenient)
  - Current_Reservoir_Levels.tsv
  - Current_Reservoir_Levels.csv


The bulk of the assignment can be found here:

* Overall notes:
** Output
Your program should only perform output in main *unless explicitly specified in this document*
** Input
- Since you have not officially covered how to deal with reading in
  the entire data set and then passing it to each function you should
  write each function so that it opens the file, reads the data and
  performs that task.
 

* Task A
- Write a function ~double east_storage(std::string date);~ that will return
  thequantity in the *East basin Storage* for that day

* Task B
- Write a function ~double min_storage();~ which will return the
  minimum storage in the East basin during 2018.
- Write a function ~double max_storage();~ which will return the 
  maximumstorage in the East basin during 2018.
* Task C
- Write a function ~std::string compare_basins(std::string date1, std::string
  date2);~ that returns a string representing the the output as
  specified in the lab description. Remember you can build the string
  by doing something like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC c++

  std::string result="";
  std::string nextline;
  for (){
    nextline = SOMETHING  ;'// figure out what to add to the output
      result = result + nextline + "\n";
   }
  return result;
#+END_SRC

and then you can compare it in a test case by embedding the ~\n~ for
the newlines: ~result.compare("09/13/2018 East\n09/13/2018 Est\n")
etc.~

* Task D
*Do not do a normal test for this task*. For this task, just put the
 code that will call this function and this particular function should
 perform output (std::cout) as specified in the main lab:

#+BEGIN_SRC c++ 
TEST_CASE("Task D"){
  // the code for calling D goes here but without CHECK or any other doctest specifics.
}

#+END_SRC
