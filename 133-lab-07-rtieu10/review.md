In class for the review code activity my code for lab 7 was reviewed by Stacey and Jia Qi He (Jacky).

 Both of my reviewers said that my code documentation was helpful and made it easy to read. However one of my reviewers, Jacky, noted that my comments were very long and could be made more concise. This would help with being able to read the actual code itself. Another thing my reviewers noted was deleting code that is commented out. Sometimes when coding, I write code that I test and later comment out because it doesn't work. I don't delete it because I like being able to see my thought process and building on my old ideas. This commentary I partially agree with because it makes the code more readable, but I also disagree because I like back tracking my steps, and building my ideas. In the future, I will probably still continue to include commented out code, but I will be more cautious in keeping the comments separate. Both of my reviewers liked the fact that my code was concise and readable because of the comments.

 I reviewed Stacey and Shumalit's code. For both people, I commented on their indentation. When I code, I always prioritize indentation because I believe it makes a difference in how readable the code is. Both people, had nested loops and did not indent the loops that were nested into the loop, and I commented on that. For Stacey I commented on her variable names. Although her code works, when I read her code I was confused by what the variables represented. In Shulamit's code, she had one empty if statement and an else statement with lines of code in it. To make her code more concise, I suggested making an if statement with the not operator (!), and including the code in the if statement, nd deleting the else statement completely. I also suggested more test cases for Shulamit. This just helps in ensuring that code covers all possible test cases.

I think important parts of code review are gaining a different perspective when it comes to looking at code. When it comes to coding, people prioritize different things when it comes to functionality, and structure. I think it's important to gain input from peers because it allows you to incorporate new methods when coding, and it also allows you to consider different aspects of coding that may have been overlooked previously.
