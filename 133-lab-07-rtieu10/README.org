* Lab 07

* File structure:
- README.org - this file. fill out the top and use it for notes
- Makefile
- main.cpp - main driver
- funcs.h / funcs.cpp -- add your functions here.
- test.cpp - add your tests
- doctest.h - testing library

The bulk of the assignment can be found here:
- https://maryash.github.io/135/labs/lab_05.html

* Overall notes:

** funcs.cpp / funcs.h

Add all your functions to these files. That is All the tasks.

** Main 

You actually don't have to put anything here.

** Test

Put sufficient test cases to show that all the tasks work.


* All Tasks

Instead of writing two separate programs, you will write one program
as we have done in the past. The program should read a program from
cin (as indicated in the lab) and output to cout. You should implement
tests for ~removeLeadingSpaces~ and ~countChar~ and any other major
functions you write.

Add a copy of "bad-code.cpp" (cut and paste from the lab description)
to your repo. 

This lab will be tested first by running the test suite (make test;
./test -s) and then by running the actual main program on sample cpp
files including bad-code.cpp.
