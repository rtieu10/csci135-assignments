* Lab 09

* File structure:
- README.org - this file. fill out the top and use it for notes
- Makefile
- main.cpp - main driver
- funcs.h / funcs.cpp -- add your functions here.
- test.cpp - add your tests
- doctest.h - testing library

The full text of the 136 version of the lab can be found here:
https://maryash.github.io/135/labs/lab_09.html


* Overall notes:
- Write your functions in funcs.cpp
- Write your tests in test.cpp
- I will test your program by running ~make test~ then ~./test~
- Don't add .o, executable or any extraneous files to the repo
- You should commit and push your work frequently
- make sure to add sufficient tests to show that everything works
 
* Specifc changes to the lab
** Tasks A,B, and C
- Create a file named *Coord3D.h* that contains the class definition:
  #+BEGIN_SRC c++
    class Coord3D {
    public:
        double x;
        double y;
        double z;
    };
  #+END_SRC
- Include it in any files that declare an instance of the
  class. Probably ~main.cpp~, ~funcs.cpp~ and ~test.cpp~. 
- Add ~Coord3D.h~ as a dependency to the appropriate lines of ~Makefile~.
- You will then be able to declare instances of this class, use, and
  access them.
- Create doctest tests to show that these three tasks are completed
  correctly.
- Remember that when the tests are run there should be no user input.
** Task D
- Do this task as specified in the main lab using a file named
  poem.cpp. 
- ~poem.cpp~ is already in the repo.
** Task E
- this task should be tested in doctests along with tasks A - C.
** Task F (optional)
- Add a new *.h* file for the class similar to the way you added
  Coord3D.h
- Show this task is completed (if you do it) using doctest tests.
