* Lab 06

* File structure:
- README.org - this file. fill out the top and use it for notes
- Makefile
- main.cpp - main driver
- funcs.h / funcs.cpp -- add your functions here.
- test.cpp - add your tests
- doctest.h - testing library

The full text of the 136 version of the lab can be found here:

* Overall notes:
- Write your functions in funcs.cpp
- Write your tests in test.cpp
- I will test your program by running ~make test~ then ~./test~
- Don't add .o, executable or any extraneous files to the repo
- You should commit and push your work frequently
- make sure to add sufficient tests to show that everything works
 
* Specifc changes to the lab
** Task A

- Do not write a separate program. Write a function ~void
  test_ascii(std::string line)~ which accepts a line of text as a
  string and prints out (does not return) the output as specified in
  the main lab.
- Run this via a test case the same way you ran the shapes test cases.

* Tasks B through D
- Do not write separate programs just add the functions to your one
  program.
- Make sure to add appropriate tests (one per function) with
  enough cases to show everything works.
