* Lab 12

* File structure:
- README.org - this file. fill out the top and use it for notes
- Makefile
- main.cpp - main driver
- funcs.h / funcs.cpp -- add your functions here.
- test.cpp - add your tests
- doctest.h - testing library

The full text of the 136 version of the lab can be found here:
https://maryash.github.io/135/labs/lab_12.html


* Overall notes:
- Write your functions in funcs.cpp
- Write your tests in test.cpp
- I will test your program by running ~make test~ then ~./test~
- Don't add .o, executable or any extraneous files to the repo
- You should commit and push your work frequently
- make sure to add sufficient tests to show that everything works
 
* Specific changes to the lab

Instead of writing separate programs for each task, solve this as you
did the other labs - functions in funcs.h/funcs.cpp and called from
main / tested from test.cpp.
