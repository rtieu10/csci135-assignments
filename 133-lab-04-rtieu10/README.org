* Lab 04

* File structure:
- README.org - this file. fill out the top and use it for notes
- Makefile
- main.cpp - main driver
- funcs.h / funcs.cpp -- add your functions here.
- test.cpp - add your tests
- doctest.h - testing library

The bulk of the assignment can be found here:

* Overall notes:
** INPUT and Output
For each task, you should write a function that accepts parameters and
performs *no keyboard input*. They should return a *std::string* with
the result. 

For example, *Task A* generates a rectangle so you should write a
routine using a signature like this: ~std::string rect(int width, int
height);~ and it should return a ~std::string~ with the
rectangle. Remember to use *\n* to represent newlines

** funcs.cpp / funcs.h

Add all your functions to these files.

** Main 

You actually don't have to put anything here.

** Test

You do not have to explicitly test each task using *CHECK* or
*REQUIRE* but you do have to put in calls in each test case to call
and print out the results for each task. For example, you might have
this for task A:

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
TEST_CASE("Task A"){
     std::string result = rect(5,3);

     std::cout << "----------- TASK A - rect ----------\n";
     std::string result = rect(5,3);
     std::cout << " rect(5,3):\n"
     std::cout << result
     std::cout << " rect(3,5):\n"
     result = rect(3,5);
     std::cout << result
     std::cout << "\n\n";x
}

#+END_SRC
